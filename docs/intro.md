title: Digital Assets on Tezos

---

Welcome to the Digital Assets Portal! 

This documentation aims to help developers streamline implementation, integration, and the use of digital assets on the Tezos blockchain. The documentation is divided in sections based on what developers want to achieve.

## Get Started with Tezos

Get started with the [Tezos CLI](/docs/setup/1-tezos-client) and a local [Tezos sandbox](/docs/setup/2-sandbox).

## Token Contracts

This section outlines smart contract specifications for tokens (digital assets) and demonstrates interactions with smart contracts implementing them. The focus is now on [FA1.2](/docs/token-contracts/fa12/1-fa12-intro) and a [Multisig contract](/docs/token-contracts/multisig-specialized/1-multisig-specialized-intro), and [FA2](https://medium.com/@TQTezos/introducing-fa2-a-multi-asset-interface-for-tezos-55173d505e5f) will be added in the future.

## Oracle
Check out this tutorial on [how to use an oracle](/docs/oracle) on Tezos. An oracle is a service that makes real-world data available on-chain, so smart contracts can interact with it.

## Experimental
This section includes tutorials demonstrating new Tezos features added in recent protocol proposals. Check out this tutorial on [auctioning ticket based NFTs](/docs/experimental/ticket-auction), which shows a potential use case for [tickets](https://medium.com/tqtezos/tickets-on-tezos-part-1-a7cad8cc71cd)-- a new Tezos primitive proposed in Edo.

## Running a Public Tezos Node
Get started with [deploying a public Tezos node on AWS](/docs/run-a-node/1-run-a-node-intro), including scripts and tools that make the cloud deployment straightforward.
