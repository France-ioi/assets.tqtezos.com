Tezos Enterprise is an open source platform that lets your enterprise build its 
own blockchain network. With unparalleled security and a built-in upgrade mechanism, 
it features mainnet compatible smart contracts, replaceable consensus algorithms, an 
infrastructure management toolkit, and an ecosystem to support your project.

 - **Develop DApps**: Develop and test DApps on your own blockchain compatible with 
 Tezos mainnet.
 - **Build Solutions**: Build blockchain solutions with the privacy and performance 
 of a stand-alone Tezos network.
 - **Integrate Your Business**: Integrate Tezos network components into your existing 
 enterprise.

## Private Chain Consensus

When building your private blockchain, you can choose between Tezos’ mainnet Liquid 
Proof-of-Stake consensus or the BFT-like consensus which does not require baking or a 
native cryptocurrency. This reduces the risks, complexities, and operational expenses 
that come with running a blockchain-based service.

## Enterprise Grade Infrastructure

Tezos Enterprise has containerized packaging with modular and configurable architecture,
 enabling versatility and scalability of cross-cloud and on-premise deployments designed
  for your specific business needs.

## Secure Key Management

Signatory secures, stores, and controls access of Tezos Enterprise encryption keys using
 on-premise HSM and Cloud services. It allows for the remote signing of transactions, and 
 uses Prometheus and Grafana for alerts and reports. You can monitor historical trends of 
 signing volumes, errors, and latencies, giving you the necessary information to check the 
 health of your system.

## Distributed Identity

Tezos Enterprise’s Decentralized Identity (DID) method offers a pragmatic balance of privacy, 
decentralization, and accessibility. It is perfectly suited for any scale consumer and B2B 
applications. Its formal verification capabilities ensure identities and credentials are 
processed securely by the private chain.

## Time Stamping and Certification

Tezos Enterprise includes a cost-effective digital signature technology that works with 
documents and data. It is intended for companies, institutions, and associations who check 
the origin, integrity, and authenticity of digital documents and artifacts they receive.
